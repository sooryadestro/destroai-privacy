  <p>
    Destro ("Destro", "we", "our", or "us") provides warehouse orchestration and automation software designed to operate within customer-controlled infrastructure environments. This Privacy Policy describes how Destro handles data in connection with our software and services.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Scope of This Policy</h2>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to the Destro software platform, including backend orchestration services, wearable interfaces, administrative dashboards, and related operational systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Destro operates as an enterprise software provider and processes operational data solely to provide system functionality on behalf of its customers.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data We Process</h2>

  <p>

    <li>Robot and system telemetry</li>
    <li>System logs and audit records</li>
    <li>Configuration and deployment information</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Destro does not collect or process personal consumer data such as names, email addresses, financial information, or personal communications.

  <h2>3. Customer-Controlled Data Environment</h2>

  <p>
    Destro software is deployed within infrastructure environments controlled and managed by customers. Customers retain ownership and control of their data at all times.
  </p>

  <p>
    Destro does not access customer data except as necessary to provide authorized support, troubleshoot operational issues, or improve system reliability, and only with appropriate authorization.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>

  <p>
    Operational data is stored only as required for active system functionality, monitoring, and operational continuity. Data retention policies are governed by customer infrastructure and deployment configuration.
  </p>

  <p>
    Destro does not independently retain customer operational data outside of customer-controlled environments unless explicitly authorized.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>

  <p>
    Destro implements industry-standard security controls to protect system and operational data, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Encrypted communication using TLS</li>
    <li>Authentication and access controls</li>
    <li>Secure containerized deployment and network isolation</li>
    <li>System logging, monitoring, and audit trails</li>
    <li>Dependency and vulnerability scanning</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Access to systems and operational data is restricted to authorized personnel and controlled through secure authentication mechanisms.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>

  <p>
    Destro does not sell, rent, or share customer operational data with third parties.
  </p>

  <p>
    Customer data remains within customer-controlled infrastructure environments unless explicitly authorized by the customer.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Customer Responsibilities</h2>

  <p>
    Customers are responsible for managing access controls, retention policies, network security, and operational security configurations within their deployment environments.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
